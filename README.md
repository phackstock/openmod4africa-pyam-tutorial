This repository is based on the work done by Daniel Huppmann for *ENGAGE Capacity
Building Workshop: the pyam package*
<https://github.com/danielhuppmann/ENGAGE-pyam-tutorial/>.

## Overview

This repository holds a [Jupyter notebook](tutorial-notebook.ipynb) for a live-demo of
the **pyam** package given as part of the OpenMod4Africa workshop on June 18, 2024.

The Jupyter notebook is based on the *ENGAGE Capacity Building Workshop: the pyam
package* (<https://github.com/danielhuppmann/ENGAGE-pyam-tutorial/>) which itself is
based on the advanced assignment of the [Modelling
Lab](https://github.com/danielhuppmann/climate-risks-academy-2021), which was part of
the *Climate Risks Academy 2021* organized by the European University Institute (EUI)
Florence School of Banking and Finance in cooperation with Oliver Wyman.

The scenario data used in this tutorial notebook is taken from the [OpenMod4Africa
Internal Scenario Explorer](https://data.ece.iiasa.ac.at/openmod4africa-internal).

## The pyam package

This exercise uses the Python package **pyam**, an open-source community toolbox for
analysis & visualization of scenario data. The package was developed to facilitate
working with timeseries scenario data conforming to the format developed by the
[Integrated Assessment Modeling Consortium (IAMC)](https://www.iamconsortium.org). The
package is used in ongoing assessments by the IPCC and in many model comparison projects
at the global and national level, including several Horizon 2020 projects.
